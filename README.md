Description:
Welcome to MS Blog, your go-to destination for the latest tech updates and insightful articles. Built and curated by Mohit Sonu, this blog is a testament to his passion for technology and web development.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: The blog is powered by the robust and versatile Express.js framework for Node.js, utilizing EJS as the templating engine to dynamically render content. The clean and intuitive user interface is designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing experience.

Backend: MongoDB, hosted on MongoDB Atlas, serves as the database to store and manage your blog posts. Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool, seamlessly integrates with Node.js.

User Authentication: Sessions are managed using the Express Session middleware to enhance security, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain routes. The login functionality is implemented with a simple username and password combination for now.

Deployment: The blog is hosted on a cloud platform, and the server is configured to run on port 7000.
